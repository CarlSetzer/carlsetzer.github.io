<h1>Alternatives To Propriatary Software</h1>
<p>Whether Microsoft, Adobe, AutoCAD, or any of the grand multitude, I like to have free options. Now, this really is "free" as in "free speech", not "free" and in "free lunch". </p>

<h2>Alternatives to Photoshop</h2>
<p>One of the more expensive software packages out there. Here are some of the options I came up with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a>: GNU Image Manipulation Program, a Photoshop alternative.</li>
    <li><a href="https://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus" target="_blank">Scribus</a>: Desktop Publishing, InDesign alternative</li>
</ul>

<h2>Microsoft Office</h2>
<p>Sure, there's <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank">Google Docs/Sheets/etc</a>. But if you're looking for a freeware option, you'll want to look elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank">Open Office</a>: I'm not sure when it became part of Apache, but I think that's a great thing.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/" target="_blank">LibreOffice</a></li>

</ul>

<h1>Just some good Open Source Tools</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://handbrake.fr/" target="_blank">Handbrake</a>: Rips video files from a DVD to your computer</li>
<li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/"target="_blank">Audacity</a>: Audio editing tool, the open version of Adobe Audition. Now, this one has had some issues lately, 
    as <a href="https://fosspost.org/audacity-is-now-a-spyware/" targe="_blank">the parent organization changed their TOS to allow them to collect/harvest user data.</a> 
    A significant number in the open source community are not happy. So I'll provide a list of options below.  </li>

</ul>

<p>Recently, I started wondering if there was an alternative to Google Analytics. Sure, there's Bing, but that's not exactly what I'm wondering. Is there something that will track
    site usage without remarketing to site visitors? Do you know? Drop me an email at carl "AT" carl setzer "DOT" com.
