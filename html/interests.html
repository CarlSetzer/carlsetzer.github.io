<!--Writing about the broader part of who I am-->

<h2>More Than Just A Tech</h2>

<img src="../images/family.jpg" alt="The Setzer family in taekwondo uniforms" class="floatleft">

<p>I consider myself a well-rounded person with a broad range of interests. This enables my ability to connect, interact with, and understand a wide-range of people. Most of my life has been spent in the Seattle area, and in many different parts, but mostly in Lynnwood. I have lived in Downtown Seattle, Bothell, Edmonds and Lynnwood, as far as this area goes. When I was in the Navy, I was stationed over in Silverdale (just north of Bremerton). Besides the Seattle area, I have also lived in California, Virginia, Rhode Island, Oregon, Florida, Idaho and the Philippines. Yet Seattle has always been home.  </p>

<h3>A Few Of My Favorite Things</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The main thing I do outside of school: taekwondo. My whole family trains together. We have been doing this for over 10 years at <a href="https://www.ysleemartialarts.com/" target="_blank">YS Lee Martial Arts</a>. I have been a black-belt for several years and am one of the instructors (during the non-covid times). Also, I manage the school's website and social media pages. </li>
	<li>Another things I enjoy: photography. I've been an amateur photographer for decades. My interest started as a boy, as my father has also long been a photo-buff. The first classes I took back when photography meant film. I now am solidly into digital photography, but still have my old film gear, too. I post work to my  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/setzers" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/carlsetzer/" target="_blank">Instagram pages</a>. </li>
	<li>I love music! Starting in elementary band, continuing all the way through high-school and into my first iteration as a college student, I played trombone. I still currently play, on occasion, in my church's bass ensemble. As a life-long Seattleite, I love the region's music scene. Besides all the great venues, we also have an amazing array of community radio stations. My favorite is <a href="www.kexp.org" target="_blank">KEXP</a>, but I also listen to <a href="https://www.king.org" target="_blank">KING FM</a>, Seattle's classical music station, and <a href="https://www.KNKX.org" target="_blank">KNKX</a>, the region's Jazz station.
