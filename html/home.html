	<br />

<p>Welcome to my little home on the web! I am Carl Setzer, and I have spent most of my life in the greater Seattle area. However, as my father was in the Navy when I was born, I spent my childhood traveling around the world. I was born in Rhode Island, then lived in California, northern Virginia, and the Philippines before returning to Seattle (my mother was born and raised in Yakima, my father in Seattle. And all my grandparents were born in Washington, too). As an adult, I lived in Oregon, Florida, and Idaho, besides several places around the Puget Sound region. This community is home to me, the deepest sense of the word. </p>

<p>Currently, I am studying web application development here at Edmonds College. For my whole I had a passion for computers and technology. For various reasons I never pursued a career in technical fields. However, over the past few years, I have gone through multiple layoffs. Finally, early in 2020 I decided enough and investigated getting an Associates in Technical Arts degree. Web development is a highly desirable skill set, and it is something that I am deeply interested in. </p>

<p>The internet, and the web, are key components of the future. Impacting so much of society, from education, government, art, music, businesses of all sorts are disrupted by the evolutions of the web. I am fascinated by this work and want to be in the middle of it. And living in the Seattle area, one of the world's great tech hubs makes this work even more exciting. I am not certain where this journey will take me but am really enjoying the path so far.</p>
