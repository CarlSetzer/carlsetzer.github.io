<p>Over this quarter I learned so very much. I came in with a rudimentary understanding of HTML before this class. Yet I understood that there was so much more to learn. This felt especially true since this is how I want to spend my future. And I was accurate in that assessment.</p>
<p>Though I have built and managed many websites, they have all utilized WordPress, Weebly, Frontpage and Netscape (going quite far back, technology-wise). I had utilized my rudimentary html in that creation, but not at any deep level. I really enjoyed getting a deeper understanding of how websites are built and how powerful html is. Diving deeply into HTML grew my interest and magnified my excitement. Though I needed to work hard, it has been extremely rewarding.</p>
<p>I started CIS 241 with only a very basic understanding of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Mainly that consisted of knowing it existed! Now I see that the possibilities that CSS offers are rich and powerful.</p>
<p>This quarter has been exciting, frustrating, and rewarding. And I have so much more to learn! I am very satisfied with my studies and look forward to next steps in my journey.</p>
